# SQL project - internet users vs. depressions
## Objective of the project

My goal was to find out if there is a visible correlation between the increase in the number of Internet users and the registered number of depression. My hypothesis was, 
that there could be a comparable increase in both time series. 

Based on the data available to me, I chose the period 1990 to 2019 and limited my analysis to Germany. For the depression values, I additionally performed a conversion
performed. I had the depression count only as a proportion of 100,000 persons. However, for better presentability, I wanted to present the absolute values based on the German 
population. To maintain accuracy, I took into account the population change from 1990 to 2019.
